## Why rust say it want to replace c++

Rust has a specfial  *Memory Management* , which is an **COMPILE-TIME memnory management base on Ownership, Borrowing and Lifetime** .

- C family: manually manage pointers and  **trust programmer access them and free correctly**. Otherwise wil cause run-time errors.
- Java: Run-time GC
- Rust: Ideally not to manage pointers manually, it has a compile-time borrow check.
